maybe implement a 'give' action for stuff like 'one player may draw a card'
so like: -action +type give +target @types player @quantity (entire other action)


or: -action +type give +givetype draw +target @types player @quantity 1 +givetarget @types player
use givetarget to pick the player
then add a method to the action class: Action.give()
self.actionType = self.givetype
then do self.actionHandler(source, target, actionAfterGive)
