# sentinelsSim
simulator for sentinels games

meant to be able to fully automate a game of sentinels of the multiverse- pick heroes, villain(s), and environment, and it'll just go

currently working:
all one-shots from temptest
play actions from hand, top of deck, and bottom of deck
heal, damage, draw, and destroy actions
ongoings that give powers that only do one thing
