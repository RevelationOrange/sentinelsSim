how to deal with powers:
powers as 'cards', with action lists etc

need to separate powers and effects, they can't be put together, unless also using a bunch of extra ifs to suss them out

hooks, in each card, connecting it to its play area, powers, and effects
might be handy
might be a rebuild
might be worth it
